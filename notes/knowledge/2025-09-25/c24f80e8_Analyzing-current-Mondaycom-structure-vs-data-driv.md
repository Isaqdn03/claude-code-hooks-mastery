your_next_decision:
  option_a_minimal:
    - "Just add Project Metrics board"
    - "Track only completed projects"
    - "Get basic profitability insights"

  option_b_comprehensive:
    - "Full data workspace setup"
    - "Transform into data-driven operation"
    - "Enable predictive analytics"

  option_c_hybrid:
    - "Start with Project Metrics + Labor Log"
    - "Add other boards as habits form"
    - "Gradual transformation"

summary_assessment: "You're 100% correct - your current Monday.com is an operational task tracker, not a data system. You're missing the goldmine of construction data that could transform your business. The 'Data Analytics Workspace' I'm proposing would run parallel to your operations, capturing the metrics that actually drive profitability and efficiency. This isn't about making your current boards more complex - it's about creating a separate data layer that feeds off your operations."

recommendation: "Which approach interests you most? I can create the Monday.com board templates and data collection scripts for whichever path you choose."
