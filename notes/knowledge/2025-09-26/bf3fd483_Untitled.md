## YAML Response

```yaml
discovery: "Critical Token Counting Discrepancy Identified"
status: "investigation_required"

discrepancy_analysis:
  claude_context_command: "91k/200k tokens (45%)"
  enhanced_status_line: "321.9K (161%) ↑320.4K/↓1.5K"
  difference: "230K tokens - 253% discrepancy"

root_cause_identified:
  issue: "Different metrics being measured"
  claude_context: "Current context window utilization (active memory)"
  status_line: "Cumulative API token usage (total processed)"
  
  explanation:
    - "Claude's /context shows tokens currently loaded in conversation memory"
    - "Status line shows total tokens processed across all API calls"
    - "These are fundamentally different measurements"

why_discrepancy_exists:
  cache_tokens: "320K+ input tokens mostly from cache creation (93% cache efficiency)"
  accumulation: "Status line sums ALL API calls, not just current context"
  session_scope: "May include tokens from multiple operations"
  
  cache_interpretation:
    - "Cache creation tokens (320.4K) are stored for efficiency"
    - "Cache read tokens contribute to context window"
    - "Created cache tokens don't occupy active context window"

correct_interpretation:
  for_context_monitoring: "Claude's /context (91K/200K = 45%) is accurate"
  for_api_cost_tracking: "Status line (321.9K total processed) is accurate"
  
  both_metrics_valuable:
    - "Context window: How much active memory is used"
    - "API usage: How many tokens have been processed (cost tracking)"

solution_needed:
  current_status: "Status line optimized for API cost tracking"
  user_requirement: "Context window percentage monitoring"
  
  action_required:
    - "Parse actual context window data instead of cumulative API usage"
    - "Find where Claude stores real context utilization metrics"
    - "Differentiate between 'tokens processed' vs 'tokens in context'"

investigation_priorities:
  1: "Find Claude's internal context tracking data source"
  2: "Separate API usage tracking from context window monitoring"
  3: "Implement dual metrics: context utilization + API costs"
  4: "Verify which token types actually consume context window"

conclusion: "Both measurements are correct for their respective purposes"
next_step: "Locate Claude's actual context window utilization data"
```
