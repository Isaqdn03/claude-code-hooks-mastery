# Response Formatting

## Standard Timeline Response
1. **Timeline Header**: Title, scope, and context
2. **Chronological Events**: Time-ordered entries with visual hierarchy
3. **Status Indicators**: Progress, completion, and issues
4. **Summary Footer**: Duration, milestones, and next steps

## Key Principles
- **Chronological Accuracy**: Events in proper time sequence
- **Visual Clarity**: Consistent ASCII art and symbols
- **Contextual Detail**: Sufficient information without overwhelming
- **Status Tracking**: Clear indicators of progress and completion
- **Scalable Format**: Works for minutes to years timeframes
- **Scannable Structure**: Easy to quickly understand timeline flow

Always aim to tell a complete story through time, showing not just what happened, but when, why, and what the outcomes were. The timeline should enable readers to understand the progression, identify patterns, and make informed decisions about future activities.
